# Brain-MRI-Simulation

Brain MR image simulation code for generating data with variable contrast, resolution and SNR. The code is an extension on the initial implementation of the [MRXCAT](https://jcmr-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12968-014-0063-3) MATLAB code (avaialble [here](https://biomed.ee.ethz.ch/mrxcat.html)) for simulating cardiac MRI.
## Installation
Clone this repo:

```copy
git clone https://github.com/Aymen-Ayaz/Brain-MRI-Simulation
cd Brain-MRI-Simulation/
```

This code was tested on MATLAB 2018b. To produce the simulated images, you would need to have the XCAT .bin subject for simulation. The .bin files for this study could be provided upon request. Note that the XCAT is a separate software which offers computerized human anatomical models for simulation. The XCAT software is available [here](https://otc.duke.edu/industry-investors/available-technologies/xcat/)
